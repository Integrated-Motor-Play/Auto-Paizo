## Overview

**Auto-Paizo** is a mobile application that was developed as part of [Rakesh Patibanda's](https://rakeshpatibanda.com/) PhD, labeled under the Integrated Motor Play initiative. This Unity-based application is designed to use the [BioGen](https://github.com/Integrated-Motor-Play/bioGen-EMS) and [BioGen 2.0](https://github.com/Integrated-Motor-Play/bioGen-EMS-2.0) devices. These devices are custom-built electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) computational systems that were used to study three projects: 1) [Auto-Paizo Games](https://exertiongameslab.org/projects/auto-paizo-games), 2) [Fused Spectatorship](https://exertiongameslab.org/projects/fused-spectatorship), and 3) [Shared Bodily Fusion](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3643834.3660723). Together, these projects propose the concept of [Body-Actuating Play (BAP)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3505270.3558367), which proposes the concept of creating digital play experiences, where the body is used as an _input_ and _output_ medium – a way to bring back the body to the center of the play experience. Built using Unity 2022.3, it leverages various Unity components to create a seamless and interactive user experience.
